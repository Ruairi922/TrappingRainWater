Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach
Core Idea:
To calculate the amount of water trapped at each position, we need:

1) The maximum height to the left of the current position.
2= The maximum height to the right of the current position.
3) The trapped water at a position is the minimum of the above two values minus the height of the current bar.

Steps:

1) Calculate maxLeft for each position:

maxLeft[i] is the tallest bar to the left of index i.
Formula: maxLeft[i] = max(maxLeft[i-1], height[i]).

2) Calculate maxRight for each position:

maxRight[i] is the tallest bar to the right of index i.
Formula: maxRight[i] = max(maxRight[i+1], height[i]).

3) Calculate trapped water:

For each position i, trapped water is: min(maxLeft[i], maxRight[i]) - height[i].
Add the trapped water at all indices to get the total trapped water.
